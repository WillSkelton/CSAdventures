# CS Adventures

**DISCLAIMER:** This is my repository for all the notes throughout my journey through the WSU Computer Science program. Since these are notes and I'm not an expert, **some of this information could be wrong** so definitly double check this information in case it turns out that I'm full of shit. I'm going to put some kind of confidence meter on my notes for how confident I am but as my dad told me "I really admire the way you're willing to stand up in cass and confidentally be wron in front of everyone."


## Introduction:
Now that we got the "Will might not know what he's talking about" disclaimer out of the way, let's talk about what this is. I hate that as I'm learning about Physics, Formal Computing, the programming language "Haskell", and other "mathy" subjects, all of the resources are either too verbose or just flat out bad. If I already knew about this stuff, I wouldn't be here. So I will be storing my "translations" here. This is mostly for my benefit because if I can explain what a "State Machine" is in a way my grandma can understand, then I have learned it. As a byproduct, there will be simple explainatins to complex things in this repository.
