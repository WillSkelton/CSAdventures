# Physics 202

## Introduction
Maybe it's just me (it probably is) but I really don't like how physics is taught at my school. For one, I absolutely detest Pearson and there sleazy business practices and their overly verbose textbooks. Theirs and every other textbook I read just jumps right into theory and huge equations with disgusting overuse of subscripts without even buying me dinner first. I want a general overview with good analogies and simple examples of things I've seen before. A quantum physics example does literally nothing for my learning. So instead, I've been structuring my notes like I'm trying to teach someone the way I want to be taught: as someone who isn't a master in the field. Here are those notes.
