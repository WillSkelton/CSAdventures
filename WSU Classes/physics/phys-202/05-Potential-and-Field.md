# Chapter 26.1: Connecting Potential and Field
Looking back at our analogy we drew in the last chapter between electric potential and gravitational potential, we pointed out that we have the force of gravity and potential energy due to gravity are closely related. We had the two equations:

$$
\text{Force} \rightarrow \vec{F} = mg
$$

$$
\text{Potential Energy} \rightarrow \vec{E} = mgh
$$

Force is how much gravity is pulling on something and potential energy is what happens the more that thing moves with or against gravity. We have a very similar with electric potential and electric field. And just like we're able to find the potential energy from the force of gravity, we can also find the electric potential given an electric field. That equation is

$$
\Delta V = V_f-V_i = -\int\limits_{s_i}^{s_f}E_s\ ds = -\int\limits_{s_i}^{s_f}\vec{E}\cdot \vec{ds}
$$

where s is the position change from point $i$ to $f$.

NOTE: the integral is negative because $\Delta V$ is $f-i$ but the integral goes from $i$ to $f$ so we have to flip the sign. **More importantly**, it tells us that our electric potential is decreasing as our charges start to comply with the electric field(s).

## Demystifying This Connection
Now that we have the book's definitions, let's try to translate it into simpler English. I'll be doing this with the help of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vek3hTjfXf4) by the YouTube user Doc Schuster.

So we have **Electric Field** is electric force over charge:
$$
\vec{E} \equiv \frac{\vec{F}_{elec}}{q}
$$
This means that the electric field is a force relative to its charge.

Now we have **force** which is a change in potential energy with respect to a change of distance. This is in line with our understanding of **work** since $W=\int \vec{F}ds$

So, similar to how electric field is force with respect to charge, electric potential is equal to potential energy with respect to charge:
$$
\Delta V \equiv \frac{\Delta U}{q}
$$

This is a lot of weird mumbo jumbo and didn't get much simpler so let's do that now. Here is the formula that relates work to the change in potential energy:
$$
\Delta U=-W
$$

This means that as if the thing we're watching moves the way our field wants it to, then the work is negative because it's east to comply with a force. However, if we resist our field, that requires us to work to overcome it.
