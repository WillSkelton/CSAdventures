# Chapter 22.1 The Charge Model

## Introduction

Have you ever slid down one of those plastic playground slides and when you get to the bottom, touch the metal rail to get up and you zap yourself? Or maybe you're pulling a nice warm fleece blanket over yourself and you see little arcs of static electricity when you run your hand over it? That's electricity baby. Let's get into it.

## Experimenting with Charge

Now, the book gives this long spiel about going into a make-believe laboratory where we can make observations. I think it's okay to drop the "my first lab coat" theatrics for now. Making observations and hypotheses about an experiment in your imagination is fucking stupid so heres my version where I tell you what's happening:

We have 5 things with us right now. We have three rods (glass, metal and plastic) that are about the size of a pencil. In addition, we have two tissue sized sheets of cloth. Wool and silk to be exact. Now we can combine one rod and on (or no) cloths together by rubbing th cloth on the rod. Here's a table to help visualize what where we're going with this:

|         | None | Wool | Silk |
| :------ | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Glass   |      |      |      |
| Metal   |      |      |      |
| Plastic |      |      |      |

### Some Pretend Experiments:

#### Experiment 1: Two Plain Ol' Plastic Rods

Before we get too crazy with this, let's say we have two plastic rods. One is hung vertically from a string and the other is in your hand. What do you think happens when you bring the one in your hand to the other one? If you said "absolutely jack shit", you'd be right. It's just two plastic rods doing what they normally do.

#### Experiment 2: Plastic Rods with a Good Silk Rubdown

Next, let's take both plastic rods and give them a good rubdown with our wool. Now what do you think will happen when you move your rod closer to the hanging rod? You should take a guess because taking a guess and being wrong is better than just agreeing with me.

The answer is: They move away from each other. If you didn't guess that, that's fine because you're currently trying to imagine something you can't possibly imagine because you don't know it.

Why do they move apart? Well the short answer is this. I'm certain you've heard the phrase "Opposites attract", usually with people choosing friends. However, this is where it originates. Like charges repel and opposites attract. Right now, we have no way of knowing what the charge is but we do know that both rods are made of plastic and we rubbed both with wool. Thus, whatever we did to them, they are the same and therefore, they repel.

#### Experiment 3: Wooly Plastic and Silky Glass

Let's do the same thing as the last experiment (#2). We'll keep the hanging rod plastic and rub it with the wool but this time, your rod is a glass one and we're going to rub it with silk. Now all we're going to do is move your glass rod to the hanging one and guess what happens.

This time, the rods move together. Again you'd have no way of knowing this and this time, you need additional information. Silk on glass generates the opposite charge that wool on plastic does. There's no way for you to know that either. That's just how those materials work.

#### Experiment 4: The great Divide

Now this one will be simple. What do you think will happen to the strength of the pushing or pulling if you change the distance? As with most distance forces, they decrease. That makes since right? Because while we don't know exactly how these forces are working, but the farther away they are, it makes sense that they'd have to work harder for the same effect.

## The Charge Model Part 1: The Beginning of the End

Okay, the last part isn't really part of the title but I have trash brain and think it's funny. I am taking this right our of the book so here we go:

1. Frictional forces, such as rubbing, add something called charge to an object or remove it from the object. The process itself is called charging. More vigorous rubbing produces a larger quantity of charge.
2. There are two and only two kinds of charge. For now we will call these “wooly plastic charge” and “silky glass charge.” Other objects can sometimes be charged by rubbing, but the charge they receive is either “plastic charge” or “glass charge.”
3. Two like charges (plastic/plastic or glass/glass) exert repulsive forces on each other. Two opposite charges (plastic/glass) attract each other.
4. The force between two charges is a long-range force. The size of the force increases as the quantity of charge increases and decreases as the distance between the charges increases.
5. Neutral objects have an equal mixture of both “plastic charge” and “glass charge.” The rubbing process somehow manages to separate the two.

## The Charge Model Part 2: The Revenge

6. There are two types of materials. Conductors are materials through or along which charge easily moves. Insulators are materials on or in which charges remain fixed in place.
7. Charge can be transferred from one object to another by contact.

## Main Takeaways:

- There are two kinds of charge
- Like charges repel and opposites attract
- Friction charges objects
- Charge is a long ranged force
- Neutral objects have a balance of both kinds of charge
- Charge is transferred through contact
- Materials can be either good or bad at transferring charge.
