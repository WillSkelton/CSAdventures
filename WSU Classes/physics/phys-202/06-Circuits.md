# Introduction

I'm getting really sick of this shit book so we're going off the grid and taking a trip to the OG: Khan Academy. Here's the link to their series on circuits: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/circuits-topic.

# Ohm's Law

So we have 3 different components: Voltage $(V)$, Current $(I)$, and Resistance $(R)$. We'll talk about these more but let's talk about the relation between them first:

We have two formulas:

$$
V = IR\ \ \ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ \ \ I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

## Drinking Straw Analogy

Let's imagine a simple drinking straw in an ice cold drink of your choice. Now, before you ask, no this straw isn't plastic so it won't be killing any sea turtles.

### Voltage

Now, if you're like me, you've probably done that thing where you put your thumb on top of the straw and pulled it out of the drink with the liquid still in it. That liquid is being pulled back into the cup by gravity but the vacuum of created by the air and your thumb keeps it the straw. Thus, there is potential energy from gravity that increases as you pull that straw out of the cup. **This is analogous to Voltage**. So in other words:

> **Voltage** is basically how badly the electricity or charge wants to go through your circuit. In technical terms, it's a change in electrical potential energy: $V = \frac{\Delta U}{q}$ or $\Delta U = qV$

An example is to think about 9V batteries and 120V wall outlets. As kids, my friends would lick the terminals on a 9V battery and if they felt a little tingle, it had a little juice left. That electricity wanted to escape and get to the ground. Then, as we grew up, they'd do other stupid shit like put paper clips in the wall outlet. The electricity **_REALLY_** wanted to get to the ground.

### Current

Back to the straw example. Imagine trying to really put the succ on your drink. If you wanted to down that bad boy, it'd take a certain amount of time. **Current** is analogous to how much stuff is going through the straw each second (or any unit of time). Thus:

> **Current** $(\frac{charge}{time})$ is how much charge is moving through the circuit each unit of time.

### Resistance

Your ability to put the succ on your drink definitely depends on the size of the straw. A "Caprisun" only has 6ox of juice but that bad boy lasts seemingly forever. Why? It has a tiny little coffee stirer straw. On the other hand, if I put a fat milkshake straw in there, I can fit a whole "Caprisun" in my mouth with one go. This is similar to how **resistance** works.

> **Resistance** is how easily electricity can go through a circuit.

### Power

This one is where our drinking straw analogy starts to fail us. **Power** is how fast energy is transformed. I guess we can say that it's analogous to exactly how much succ you're putting on your straw which translates to how fast your drink is being transferred from your cup to your mouth.
